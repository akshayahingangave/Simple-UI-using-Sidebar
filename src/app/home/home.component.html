<p>A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing
    staff and
    medical equipment. The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency
    department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A
    district
    hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and
    additional
    beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation
    hospitals,
    children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs
    such as
    psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can
    help
    reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or
    government depending on the sources of income received.</p>
<p>A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses. A medical
    facility
    smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery
    and urgent
    care) and specialist units such as cardiology. Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have
    chronic
    treatment units. Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.

    Hospitals are usually funded by public funding, health organisations (for profit or nonprofit), health
    insurance
    companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. Historically, hospitals were often founded
    and
    funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.</p>
